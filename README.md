## ✨ Features

This starter kit provides a comprehensive set of powerful features to help you quickly build full-featured SaaS applications:

- **Authentication (Better-Auth + Resend):** Integrated with [Better-Auth](https://better-auth.com/), providing secure magic link login and third-party OAuth functionality. Uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) for reliable email delivery with Mailchecker integration to avoid temporary emails.
- **Machine Auth for APIs and Agents:** Includes per-user API keys, CLI access tokens, refresh-token rotation, and a versioned `/api/v1/*` surface for machine clients.
- **Modern Web Framework (Next.js 16 + TypeScript):** Built on the latest [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router and Server Components. The entire project uses strict TypeScript type checking.
- **Internationalization (Lingo.dev Compiler):** Built-in localization workflow powered by `@lingo.dev/compiler` for App Router. See [docs/i18n-lingo.md](docs/i18n-lingo.md).
- **Database & ORM (Drizzle + PostgreSQL):** Uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for type-safe database operations with deep PostgreSQL integration. Supports schema migrations and optimized queries.
- **Payments & Subscriptions (Creem):** Integrated with [Creem](https://creem.io/) as the payment provider for easy subscription and one-time payment handling.
- **UI Component Library (shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS):** Built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), an accessible, composable component library based on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS with built-in theme support.

> **Tip:** You can generate a secure key using the following command:
> `openssl rand -base64 32`
>
> **Optional local CLI auth:** for scripts, local agents, or quick terminal access, you can export `SAAS_CLI_API_KEY=ssk_...` instead of storing credentials in the CLI config.

#### Analytics Script

The root layout includes UllrAI's self-hosted analytics script. It is intentionally not exposed as a reusable `.env` setting because the bundled website ID only works with UllrAI's own analytics service. If you fork this starter or use it as a template, replace that script in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your own analytics provider, or remove it entirely.

### 4. Database Setup

This project uses a single Drizzle config file, `src/database/config.ts`, and a single committed migration history in `src/database/migrations/`. The target database is selected only by `DATABASE_URL`.

#### Local development

For fast local iteration against your own database:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

If the schema change should be reviewed, committed, or shared with other environments, create and apply a real migration instead:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

#### Staging and production

Shared environments should use committed SQL migrations only:

```bash
# 1. Generate and commit the migration from your schema change
pnpm db:generate

# 2. Deploy the code that includes the new migration files

# 3. Run migrations once against the target DATABASE_URL
pnpm db:migrate
```

> **Recommended release practice**
>
> - **Never** use `pnpm db:push` in staging or production.
> - Keep one migration history for all environments. Do not split migrations into dev/prod trees.
> - Run `pnpm db:migrate` as a dedicated one-shot release step in CI/CD or your deploy platform.
> - Do **not** run migrations on every application process startup.
> - Make schema changes backward-compatible when possible, so app rollout and migration timing stay safe.

### 5. Content Management (Content Collections)

The project uses Content Collections plus plain Markdown files for blog content. Posts live in locale-scoped paths such as `content/blog/en/*.md` and `content/blog/zh-Hans/*.md`, authors live in `content/authors/*.json`, and build-time generation produces typed collections for the blog pages and sitemap.

- **Authoring workflow:** Add or edit posts directly in the repository with frontmatter and Markdown content.
- **Generated content data:** Run `pnpm content:build` to refresh the generated collections manually. The command is already wired into the build, test, and type-check scripts.
- **Production behavior:** There is no CMS admin route or runtime content API. All blog content is built from the repository content files.

### 6. Agent-Friendly API and CLI Auth

This starter distinguishes clearly between human auth and machine auth:

- **Browser users:** Better Auth session cookies for the web app
- **Server-to-server and agent access:** user-managed API keys
- **Local developer tools:** browser-approved device login via `saas-cli`

What ships today:

- versioned machine endpoints under `/api/v1/*`
- API key creation and revocation in Dashboard Settings
- CLI session review and revocation in Dashboard Settings
- a terminal workflow for signing in from local tools without reusing browser session tokens

Quick examples:

```bash
# Sign in a local CLI through the browser
pnpm saas-cli -- auth login --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Check current CLI auth state
pnpm saas-cli -- auth status --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Use an API key for scripts or coding agents
SAAS_CLI_API_KEY=ssk_your_key_here pnpm saas-cli -- auth status --base-url http://localhost:3000
```

The web app exposes management surfaces at `/dashboard/developer` for both API keys and authorized CLI sessions.

### 7. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now your application should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

### 8. Admin Account Setup

For security reasons, the first registered user is not promoted automatically. Use the admin script after the user has signed up normally:

```bash
pnpm set:admin --email=your-email@example.com
```

The command loads `.env` if it exists and otherwise uses the current process environment, so the same command works locally and on a server.

After successful execution, the user receives `super_admin` privileges and can access `/dashboard/admin`.

**Security tips**

- Grant this role only to trusted users.
- Run the command in a secure environment with the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

## 🧪 E2E Testing

This repository includes a Playwright smoke test suite in `e2e/` for the most important browser-level flows:

- unauthenticated dashboard redirect
- authenticated dashboard access
- admin permission gating
- locale canonicalization for marketing routes
- API key creation and machine-auth verification
- browser-approved device auth for CLI sign-in

## Layout Widths

- Use `ShellContainer` for the marketing header, footer, and other truly wide layouts.
- Use `SectionContainer` for standard marketing sections and non-dashboard page bodies.
- Use `ReadingContainer` for blog articles, legal pages, and other long-form reading surfaces.
- Use `CompactContainer` for auth flows.
- Use `FocusContainer` for payment status and other centered cards that need more space.
- Keep full-bleed backgrounds separate from content width. Backgrounds can span the viewport while content stays inside one semantic container.

Run the suite with:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

The Playwright runner starts the production server through `pnpm start` and enables a test-only session route with `E2E_TEST_MODE=true`. That route requires an explicit `E2E_TEST_SECRET` of at least 32 characters, signs the test cookie with that secret, and is disabled for non-local production deployments. Playwright generates a per-run secret when one is not provided by CI.

## 📁 File Upload Feature

This project integrates a secure file upload system based on Cloudflare R2.

### 1. Cloudflare R2 Configuration

1. **Create R2 Bucket**: Log into Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to R2 and create a new bucket.
2. **Get API Token**: In the R2 overview page, click "Manage R2 API Tokens", create a token with "Object Read & Write" permissions. Note down the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`.
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Fill your R2 credentials and information into the `.env` file.
4. **Configure CORS Policy**: To allow browsers to upload files directly, you need to configure CORS policy in your R2 bucket's "Settings". Add the following configuration, replacing the URLs in `AllowedOrigins` with your own:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

### 2. Using the `FileUploader` Component

We provide a powerful `FileUploader` component that supports drag-and-drop, progress display, image compression, and error handling.

#### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { FileUploader } from "@/components/ui/file-uploader";

function MyComponent() {
  const handleUploadComplete = (files) => {
    console.log("Upload complete:", files);
    // Handle uploaded file information here
  };

  return (
    <FileUploader
      acceptedFileTypes={["image/png", "image/jpeg", "application/pdf"]}
      maxFileSize={5 * 1024 * 1024} // 5MB
      maxFiles={3}
      onUploadComplete={handleUploadComplete}
    />
  );
}
```

> **Note**: This project uses a `src` directory structure. All components and library files are located in the `src/` directory and can be accessed through the `@/` path mapping which resolves to `src/`.

#### Image Compression

The component includes built-in client-side image compression functionality that can reduce image file size before upload, saving bandwidth and storage space.

```tsx
<FileUploader
  acceptedFileTypes={["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/webp"]}
  enableImageCompression={true}
  imageCompressionQuality={0.7} // Compression quality (0.1-1.0)
  imageCompressionMaxWidth={1200} // Maximum width after compression
/>
```

## 📊 Bundle Size Monitoring & Optimization

This project integrates `@next/bundle-analyzer` to help you analyze and optimize your application's bundle size.

### How to Run Analysis

```bash
# Analyze production build
pnpm analyze

# Analyze in development mode
pnpm analyze:dev
```

After execution, bundle size analysis reports for both client and server will automatically open in your browser.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Dynamic Imports**: Use `next/dynamic` for code splitting of large components or libraries that aren't needed on first screen.
- **Dependency Optimization**:
  - **Tree Shaking**: Ensure you only import what you need from libraries, e.g., `import { debounce } from 'lodash-es';` instead of `import _ from 'lodash';`.
  - **Lightweight Alternatives**: Consider using lighter libraries, e.g., replace `moment.js` with `date-fns`.
- **Image Optimization**: Prioritize using Next.js `<Image>` component and enable WebP format.

## ☁️ Deployment

We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment as it seamlessly integrates with Next.js.

1. **Push to Git Repository:**
   Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

2. **Import Project in Vercel:**
   - Log into your Vercel account, click "Add New... > Project", then select your Git repository.
   - Vercel will automatically detect this is a Next.js project and configure the build settings.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - In your Vercel project's "Settings" -> "Environment Variables", add all the environment variables you defined in your `.env` file. **Do not commit the `.env` file to your Git repository**.

4. **Configure Database Migration as a Release Step:**
   Run `pnpm db:migrate` once in a dedicated CI/CD or platform release step using the production `DATABASE_URL`. Avoid running migrations from web process startup hooks.

5. **Deploy!**
   After completing the above steps, Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application every time you push to the main branch.
